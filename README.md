# The Odin Project Portfolio

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is an Open Source coding bootcamp designed to give everyone a free alternative to a computer science education.

The path I chose to take is the [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) path after completing the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations) prerequisite. 


Check out my projects below! There is a link to the GitHub Repository as well as the live preview.
